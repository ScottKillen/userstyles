This repository hosts a collection of user-created themes and styles designed to enhance the browsing experience on specific websites. These themes and styles allow users to customize the appearance of websites, improving readability and visual appeal according to individual preferences.

## Installation

To use these themes and styles, you'll typically need a browser extension that allows you to apply custom CSS to websites. Popular choices include:

*   **Stylus:** Available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/).
*   **Tampermonkey:** Available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd), [Safari](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?ext=dhdg&browser=safari), and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/).

**General Steps to Install a Style:**

1.  **Install the Extension:** Add your chosen extension (e.g., Stylus) to your browser.
2.  **Find a Style:** Each theme/style in this repository will either have a direct link to a userstyles.world page or its CSS code directly in a `.css` file.
3.  **Install via Userstyles.world:**
    *   If a `userstyles.world` link is provided, click it.
    *   On the style's page, look for an "Install Style" button (or similar wording) provided by your browser extension. Click it to install.
4.  **Install via CSS Code:**
    *   If the style is provided as a `.css` file, open the file and copy its content.
    *   Open your browser extension's management dashboard (usually accessible from the browser's toolbar).
    *   Look for an option like "Write new style" or "Add new script".
    *   Paste the copied CSS code into the editor.
    *   Specify which website(s) the style should apply to. This information is usually found in the style's description within this repository.
    *   Save the new style.

Please refer to the specific documentation of your chosen browser extension for more detailed instructions.
